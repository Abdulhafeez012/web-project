                bodies, large ears, and
                long
                trunks. They
                use their trunks to pick up objects, trumpet warnings, greet other elephants, or suck up water for
                drinking or bathing,
                among other uses. Both male and female African elephants grow tusks and each individual can either be
                left- or
                right-tusked, and the one they use more is usually smaller because of wear and tear. Elephant tusks
                serve many purposes. " <br><strong>Author By Jack Edison</strong></p>

        <div class="row row-cols-2 justify-content-evenly my-4 py-4">
            <p class="col align-self-end pe-5">" The lion is a well-muscled cat with a long body, large head, and short
                legs. Size and appearance vary considerably
                between the sexes. The male’s outstanding characteristic is his mane, which varies between different
                individuals and
                populations. It may be entirely lacking; it may fringe the face; or it may be full and shaggy, covering
                the back of the
                head, neck, and shoulders and continuing onto the throat and chest to join a fringe along the belly. In
                some lions the
                mane and fringe are very dark, almost black, giving the cat a majestic appearance. Manes make males look
                larger and may
                serve to intimidate rivals or impress prospective mates. A full-grown male is about 1.8–2.1 metres (6–7
                feet) long,
                excluding the 1-metre tail; he stands about 1.2 metres high at the shoulder and weighs 170–230 kg
                (370–500 pounds). The
                female, or lioness, is smaller, with a body length of 1.5 metres, a shoulder height of 0.9–1.1 metres,
                and a weight of
                120–180 kg. The lion’s coat is short and varies in color from buff yellow, orange-brown, or silvery
                gray to dark brown,
                with a tuft on the tail tip that is usually darker than the rest of the coat. " <br><strong>Author By

        <div class="row row-cols-2 justify-content-evenly my-4 py-4">
            <p class="col align-self-end pe-5">" Gorillas are gentle giants and display many human-like behaviors and
                emotions, such as laughter and sadness. In fact,
                gorillas share 98.3% of their genetic code with humans, making them our closest cousins after
                chimpanzees and bonobos.
                The largest of the great apes, gorillas are stocky animals with broad chests and shoulders, large,
                human-like hands, and
                small eyes set into hairless faces. The two gorilla species live in equatorial Africa, separated by
                about 560 miles of
                Congo Basin forest. Each has a lowland and upland subspecies. Gorillas live in family groups of usually
                five to 10, but
                sometimes two to more than 50, led by a dominant adult male—or silverback—who holds his position for
                years. The bond
                between the silverback and his females forms the basis of gorilla social life. Females become sexually
                mature around
                seven or eight years old but don’t begin to breed until a couple of years later. Males mature at an even
                greater age.
                Once a female begins to breed, she'll likely give birth to only one baby every four to six years and
                only three or four
                over her entire lifetime. This low rate of reproduction makes it difficult for gorillas to recover from
                population
                declines. Both gorilla species have been decreasing in numbers for decades, and a 2010 United Nations
                report suggests
                that they may disappear from large parts of the Congo Basin by the mid-2020s.Gorillas are gentle giants

                confined summit area, and considerable local relief. Mountains generally are understood to be larger
                than hills, but the
                term has no standardized geological meaning. Very rarely do mountains occur individually. In most cases,
                they are found
                in elongated ranges or chains. When an array of such ranges is linked together, it constitutes a
                mountain belt. For a
